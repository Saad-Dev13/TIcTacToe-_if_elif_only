# Tic Tac Toe (Python, First Semester ICT Project)

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python as a project for the first semester of ICT. The project is designed to help beginners build programming basics using only `if` and `elif` statements, with no advanced programming techniques or libraries.

## Features

- **Multiplayer Mode:** Two players can play against each other.
- **Single Player Mode:** Play against the computer. The computer is unbeatableâ€”either the game draws or the computer wins.
- **Simple Console Interface:** All interactions happen in the terminal.
- **Educational Purpose:** The code is intentionally written using only basic control structures to help students understand fundamental programming concepts.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x).
2. Download the file [`FA22-BCS-048 (Final Tic Tac Toe) submitted WITH COMMENTS.py`](d:/OneDrive/OneDrive%20-%20Higher%20Education%20Commission/University%20Data/1st%20Semester/ICT/Lab/Lab%20Assignments/Python/(FA22-BCS-048)%20Tik%20Tak%20Toe/Final%20Assignment/FA22-BCS-048%20(Final%20Tic%20Tac%20Toe)%20submitted%20WITH%20COMMENTS.py).
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the file.
4. Run the game with:

    ```sh
    python "FA22-BCS-048 (Final Tic Tac Toe) submitted WITH COMMENTS.py"
    ```

## Project Notes

- This project is for educational purposes and demonstrates the use of basic Python constructs.
- No functions, classes, or advanced data structures are used beyond what is necessary for the assignment.
- In single-player mode, the computer uses a hardcoded strategy to ensure it never loses.
